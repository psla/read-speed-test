This project contains two read speed tests. One written in C#, one written in C++ (well... C mostly).

The C++ one is significantly faster.

Note that very little sanity check is done, DO NOT USE WITH UNTRUSTED INPUTS.

# Launch C++

```
cd ReadSpeedTestNative
bazel build -c opt :read-speed-test
Get-ChildItem C:\tmp\*.[a-z][a-z][a-z]  |% { .\bazel-out\x64_windows-opt\bin\read-speed-test.exe $_.FullName }
```

# DD?

This is supposed to output format similar to dd.

In fact, if WSL (windows subsystem for linux) offered better performance, I would use DD. However, I couldn't get past 80MB/s in WSL on my network interface.

dd counterpart:

```
dd if=filename of=/dev/null
```

optionally with (bs=81920).
